/**
 * To fulfill a JSON API request, you often need to know about all the 
 * resources in the system--not just the primary resource associated with
 * the type being requested. For example, if the request is for a User, 
 * you might need to include related Projects, so the code handling the users
 * request needs access to the Project resource's beforeSave and afterQuery 
 * methods. Similarly, it would need access to url templates that point at 
 * relationships on the Project resources, to return those templates with the
 * included Projects. Etc. So we handle this by introducing a ResourceTypeRegistry 
 * that the BaseController can have access to. Each resource type is registered
 * by its name (the JSON api type value) and has four properties: adapter, 
 * urlTemplates, and the beforeSave and afterQuery methods.

    # Note: although urlTemplates are registered as part of a resource, the
    # paths they're registered with and the names of template variables should 
    # be global for now. I.e. the users resource type registers a template as:
    # "users.profile": "http://example.com/api/profiles/{users.profile}".
    # It does NOT do: "profile": "http://example.com/api/profiles/{profile}".
    # This is because, even though the latter makes more sense from the
    # resource's POV (as specifying the type in paths is redundant), it would
    # require us to write logic converting the paths in template variables to
    # global paths, and that could be tricky.
